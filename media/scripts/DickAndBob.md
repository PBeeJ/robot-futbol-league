# Meet Dick ??? (need a last name for Dick) and and Bob Kishbutt

Dick and Bob are sportscasters circa early 1970s. They work hard to be informed, new age men, but often fall way short of that goal. They are known to frequently verbalize expletives or other racy comments that network censors have no choice but to bleep out. Needless to say, Dick and Bob make for an interesting game.
