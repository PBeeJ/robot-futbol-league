This program reads data from the marvelmind modem connected via USB and streams it to the game-controller over it's TCP websocket.

This was originally checked in to the repo from the marvelmind 2021_01_31 sw download,  API/example_source directory.

I altered after initial check in to connect to the socket and send 2D position data as fast as possible.
